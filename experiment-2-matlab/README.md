**Experiment #2**
We aimed to make our progress on a different matlab code by changing our data sets and related functions in this experiment.

Since the dataset we used in this experiment consisted of only emg signals, it was quite successful in increasing our consistency rate.
Our consistency rate, which we reached to 72% in our previous experiment, was able to reach high consistency levels such as 97% by 
applying similar operations in this dataset.When we thought that we had reached sufficient levels of consistency in the matlab code 
we were working on, we started to translate our application to c language. Since Matlab-specific functions are also translated into
c language, this part was longer and more difficult than we thought. We aim to integrate each function we use here into the c language
one by one and successfully calculate consistency there.
