**HDACC: Hardware Acceleration of Brain-Inspired Hyperdimensional Computing forHand Gesture Recognition using Electromyography (EMG) Signals**

This project aims to calculate EMG signals with HD computing method and accelerate it on hardware.
As you can see in the project files, the developments made under the name of 3 different experiments 
were recorded. Our first experiment was to try HD computing methods on a dataset that was not 
exactly what we wanted. During this experiment, we worked on encoding and HD computing methods. 
Since the accuracy of the experiment was not sufficient, we searched for a second experimental dataset. 
We were able to perform experiments with higher accuracy on this dataset. The next step after the 
experiments were completed was that these codes could run first in the c language and then on the 
hardware. We were not successful because of the code conversion and algorithm we experienced during 
these stages. 

**Therefore, our project could not be completed successfully.**
