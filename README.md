**HDACC: Hardware Acceleration of Brain-Inspired Hyperdimensional Computing forHand Gesture Recognition using Electromyography (EMG) Signals**

**Project introduction:**

Our project was prepared for the xilinx open hw competition within the scope of our EEM 464 
System-on-Chip Design course.You can examine the hdc encode functions we tried in our 
experiment-1-matlab folder and how the accuracy changes with the values we changed on certain parameters.
In our experiment-2-matlab folder, we tried to draw attention to how progress can be achieved with 
similar encode functions if the data set is changed.In the experiment-3-code-transformation folder, 
we started the conversion of these codes to c language, but the process failed.

**Goals:**

If our project had been completed successfully, we would test how fast our system was run by running it 
on hardware. but for now, the project has not been completed as this stage has not been reached.

**Project:** 

This project aims to calculate EMG signals with HD computing method and accelerate it on hardware.
As you can see in the project files, the developments made under the name of 3 different experiments 
were recorded. Our first experiment was to try HD computing methods on a dataset that was not 
exactly what we wanted. During this experiment, we worked on encoding and HD computing methods. 
Since the accuracy of the experiment was not sufficient, we searched for a second experimental dataset. 
We were able to perform experiments with higher accuracy on this dataset. The next step after the 
experiments were completed was that these codes could run first in the c language and then on the 
hardware (Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC Architecture). We were not successful because of the code conversion 
and algorithm we experienced during these stages. 

**Therefore, this project could not be completed successfully.**
