**Experiment #1**

We did our first experiment on Matlab.
The algorithm we presented lastly gave us an accuracy rate of 62% by performing HD computing operations.
While calculating this accuracy rate, different body signals in the dataset prevented us from getting the 
desired accuracy rate. We aimed to increase the consistency rate by changing some inputs and calculation
methods of HD computing on the algorithm. The feature we changed was N-gram and bipolar mapping sparse. 
These properties that we changed had different effects on the accuracy as they changed the window size 
and the method of transporting the data. We aimed that the values we have chosen to be close to the 
values obtained in the previous research with optimum results.
