Experiment #1

In this experiment, we first carried out our studies on the hdc code that we had researched and learned the encoding processes.

We aimed to increase our accuracy rate by making changes on the learning rate and window sizes. 
Thanks to these changes we made, we were able to increase our consistency, which was around 60% at the beginning, to 72%. 
However, we stopped working on this code because the data set we used was not fully suitable for our needs and other elements reduced our consistency.
